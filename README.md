# PostIt HomeMade API

This API has been created by Thomas HUGUES in order for you to understand how a basic API works.

You can use this API for your PostIt project, as it uses the endpoints specified in the subject. 

## How to run ?

Simply run the following commands :

```
npm install (or yarn install)
npm run start:dev (or yarn start:dev)
```

## Specificities

Do **NOT** delete the `notes.json` file.
As it is purely local and a completely turnkey solution, you will not need to spend time to setup a database.
Instead, the file `notes.json` will be used as storage for your posts.

Have fun (:
